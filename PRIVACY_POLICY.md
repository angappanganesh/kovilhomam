# Family Welfare Homam : Privacy Policy

Welcome to 'Family Welfare Homam' app for Android!

## Data Collection

This is a very simple app to register for homam and volunteering at [Aramm Valartha Naayagi Sevai Maiyam](https://arram.org.in/).

The only permission required by the app is
uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"

App collects name, birth date, address, email and phone number manually from the user for both homam registration and volunteering. It is completely up to the user's discretion to enter these details and registering for homam or volunteering with Aramm Valartha Naayagi Sevai Maiyam organization.

- Homam registration data is purged few days after the homam is completed
- Volunteer data is purged once the user no longer wishes to volunteer

For any deletion/update requirements, please contact Venkat - venkatavel@gmail.com.
For any app related feedback/information, please contact Ganesh - angappan.ganesh@gmail.com.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it.

Thanks for using the app!

Ganesh
